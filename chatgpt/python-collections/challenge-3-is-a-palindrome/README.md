# Challenge 3: Palindrome Check
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns True if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and False otherwise. Ignore whitespace and consider uppercase and lowercase characters as the same.


```python
Input: "Able was I saw Elba"
```
